This is a complete testing scaffold allowing for on-board test coverage
for:

- RTEMS EDISOFT
- RTEMS OAR
- Linux

I've written a blog post to describe the theory behind my approach, here:
[https://www.thanassis.space/coverage.html](https://www.thanassis.space/coverage.html).

Even though my example code is RTEMS-related, the approach is actually
generic enough to apply to any embedded target supported by a GCC toolchain.

I attach no license to my code - you are free to re-use it as you see fit.
